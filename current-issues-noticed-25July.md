# Current Issues Resolution Plan - 25 July

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis and resolution plan for the multiplayer issues identified in the CLAUDE.md file on July 25th.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working
- Backend server is running on port 8080
- Database (PostgreSQL) is properly configured and operational
- CORS issues have been resolved
- Authentication (login/register) is functional
- JWT token-based authorization is working
- Users can create challenges using name#ID format

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Real-time Challenge Notifications Missing
**Issue**: When player X sends a challenge to player Y, it doesn't appear on Y's browser until refresh
**Root Cause**: No real-time communication mechanism between frontend and backend
**Solution Required**: Implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates

#### 2. Challenge Acceptance Flow Broken
**Issue**: Player Y needs to refresh to see challenges, Player X needs to refresh to see accepted challenges
**Root Cause**: Similar to issue #1 - lack of real-time updates
**Solution Required**: Same as above - WebSocket implementation

#### 3. Multiplayer Games Redirecting to AI Games
**Issue**: Both players are directed to play against computer instead of each other
**Root Cause**: Game creation logic is not properly linking multiplayer games
**Solution Required**: Fix game creation flow to properly establish P2P games

#### 4. No Real Multiplayer Implementation
**Issue**: The current implementation doesn't support actual player vs player gameplay
**Root Cause**: Missing WebSocket game synchronization and state management
**Solution Required**: Implement real-time game state synchronization

## Technical Architecture Analysis

```

### Database Schema (Inferred)
- `users` table: id, name, email, password_hash
- `challenges` table: id, challenger_id, challenged_id, status, created_at
- `games` table: (needs investigation)

### Frontend API Integration
- `api.js`: Contains GwentAPI class with methods for auth, challenges, and games
- WebSocket connection code exists but may not be properly implemented

## Resolution Plan

### Phase 1: Investigate Current WebSocket Implementation
1. Check `backend/internal/api/websocket.go` for existing implementation
2. Verify WebSocket routes in `main.go` (already exists: `/ws/game/{gameId}`)
3. Check if GameHub is properly managing connections
4. Review frontend WebSocket connection in `api.js`

### Phase 2: Fix Real-time Updates
1. Implement challenge notification system via WebSocket
2. Create a notification hub for challenge events
3. Update frontend to listen for challenge notifications
4. Ensure bidirectional communication for challenge accept/reject

### Phase 3: Fix Multiplayer Game Creation
1. Review `RespondToChallenge` handler to ensure it creates proper multiplayer games
2. Fix game creation to link both players correctly
3. Ensure game state is shared between players, not AI

### Phase 4: Implement Game Synchronization
1. Use existing WebSocket infrastructure for game moves
2. Implement proper game state broadcasting
3. Ensure moves are validated server-side
4. Sync game state between both players

## Key Files to Investigate/Modify

### Backend Files
1. `/home/gwynbliedd/gwent/backend/internal/api/websocket.go` - WebSocket implementation
2. `/home/gwynbliedd/gwent/backend/internal/api/game_handlers.go` - Game creation logic
3. `/home/gwynbliedd/gwent/backend/cmd/server/main.go` - WebSocket routing
4. `/home/gwynbliedd/gwent/backend/internal/models/` - Data models

### Frontend Files
1. `/home/gwynbliedd/gwent/api.js` - WebSocket client implementation
2. `/home/gwynbliedd/gwent/menu.html` - Challenge UI updates
3. `/home/gwynbliedd/gwent/multiplayer.js` - Multiplayer game logic
4. `/home/gwynbliedd/gwent/gwent.js` - Core game engine integration

## Testing Plan
1. Create two test users
2. Send challenge from user A to user B
3. Verify real-time notification appears
4. Accept challenge and verify both players enter same game
5. Make moves and verify synchronization
6. Complete game and verify results

## Environment Setup
- Backend: Go server running on port 8080
- Database: PostgreSQL with gwent_db
- Frontend: Served on port 8000
- WebSocket: ws://localhost:8080/ws/game/{gameId}

## Next Steps
1. Start by investigating existing WebSocket implementation
2. Add logging to track game creation flow
3. Implement missing real-time features
4. Test thoroughly with multiple browser sessions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Challenges appear instantly without refresh
- [ ] Challenge acceptance redirects both players to same game
- [ ] Players play against each other, not AI
- [ ] Game moves sync in real-time
- [ ] No page refreshes required during gameplay
